# Short Page CV

A minimal, print-friendly single-file CV built with semantic HTML and simple CSS.

Files
- [index.html](index.html) — main CV markup and styles.
- [assets/](assets/) — image and favicon assets (e.g. `cv.svg`).

Preview
- Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser to view the CV.

Usage
- Edit [index.html](index.html) to replace the placeholder name, contact info, education, experience and skills.
- Update the SVG or favicon in [assets/](assets/) if desired.

Customization tips
- Change the page title and meta tags in the head of [index.html](index.html) for SEO/social sharing.
- Modify the embedded styles in [index.html](index.html) to adjust colors, spacing, fonts, or print layout.
- Keep semantic elements (header, address, section, article) for accessibility and better printing.

Accessibility & best practices
- Use real text for headings and lists so screen readers can parse content.
- Keep contrast high and prefer readable font sizes for printing and low-vision users.
- Ensure links (email, external profiles) include clear link text.

License
- Use and modify freely.
